## About<a name = "about"></a>

A matrimonial application where users can browse potential brides and grooms, connect with each other through messaging and video calls. The primary goal of the application is to facilitate the process of finding a suitable partner for marriage.

The application will have a database of user profiles that can be filtered by various criteria such as age, location, religion, education, occupation, etc. Users will be able to browse through these profiles and shortlist the ones that interest them.

To initiate communication, users can send messages to each other, and if both parties agree, they can also have video calls to get to know each other better. The messaging and video call features will be built into the application, and users will be able to use them without leaving the app.

In addition to browsing profiles and communicating with potential partners, users will also be able to create their own profiles that include their personal details, preferences, and a brief summary about themselves. This will help other users get to know them better and increase their chances of finding a suitable match.

To ensure the safety and security of users, the application will include features such as account verification, privacy settings, and a reporting system for any inappropriate behavior. The user data will also be protected using encryption and other security measures.

Overall, the application aims to simplify and streamline the process of finding a partner for marriage, while also providing a safe and secure platform for users to connect and communicate with each other.
